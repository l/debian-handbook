            class="para">
				In 2003, Nat Makarévitch contacted Raphaël because he wanted to publish a book on Debian in the <span
              class="foreignphrase"><em
                class="foreignphrase">Cahier de l'Admin</em></span> (Admin's Handbook) collection that he was managing for Eyrolles, a leading French editor of technical books. Raphaël immediately accepted to write it. The first edition came out on 14th October 2004 and was a huge success — it was sold out barely four months later.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				Since then, we have released 6 other editions of the French book, one for each subsequent Debian release. Roland, who started working on the book as a proofreader, gradually became its co-author.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				While we were obviously satisfied with the book's success, we always hoped that Eyrolles would convince an international editor to translate it into English. We had received numerous comments explaining how the book helped people to get started with Debian, and we were keen to have the book benefit more people in the same way.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				Alas, no English-speaking editor that we contacted was willing to take the risk of translating and publishing the book. Not put off by this small setback, we negotiated with our French editor Eyrolles and got back the necessary rights to translate the book into English and publish it ourselves. Thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign, we worked on the translation between December 2011 and May 2012. The “Debian Administrator's Handbook” was born and it was published under a free-software license!
			</div><div
            class="para">
				While this was an important milestone, we already knew that the story would be not be over for us until we could contribute the French book as an official translation of the English book. This was not possible at that time because the French book was still distributed commercially under a non-free license by Eyrolles.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				In 2013, the release of Debian 7 gave us a good opportunity to discuss a new contract with Eyrolles. We convinced them that a license more in line with the Debian values would contribute to the book's success. That wasn't an easy deal to make, and we agreed to setup another crowdfunding campaign to cover some of the costs and reduce the risks involved. The operation was again a huge success and in July 2013, we added a French translation to the Debian Administrator's Handbook.

				We are back in 2011 and we just got the required rights to make an English translation of our French book. We are looking into ways to make this happen.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				Translating a book of 450 pages is a considerable effort that requires several months of work. Self-employed people like us had to ensure a minimum income to mobilize the time necessary to complete the project. So we set up a crowdfunding campaign on Ulule and asked people to pledge money towards the project. <div
              class="url">→ <a
                href="http://www.ulule.com/debian-handbook/">http://www.ulule.com/debian-handbook/</a></div>
			</div><div
            class="para">
				The campaign had two goals: raising €15,000 for the translation and completing a €25,000 liberation fund to get the resulting book published under a free license — that is, a license that fully follows the Debian Free Software Guidelines.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				When the Ulule campaign ended, the first goal had been achieved with €24,345 raised. The liberation fund was not complete however, with only €14,935 raised. As initially announced, the liberation campaign continued independently from Ulule on the book's official website.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				While we were busy translating the book, donations towards the liberation continued to flow in… And in April 2012, the liberation fund was completed. You can thus benefit from this book under the terms of a free license.

				After the publication of the English book under a free software licence, we were in a weird situation with a free book which is a translation of a non-free book (since it was still distributed commercially under a non-free license by Eyrolles).

				We knew that fixing this would require us to convince Eyrolles that a free license would contribute to the book's success.

We would like to thank Marilyne Brun, who helped us to translate the sample chapter and who worked with us to define some common translation rules.

Stefano Zacchiroli — who was Debian Project Leader during the crowdfunding campaign — also deserves a big thank you, he kindly endorsed the project with a quote explaining that free (as in freedom) books were more than needed.

				I am extremely grateful to Raphaël for taking on the administrative part of this English edition. From organizing the funding campaign to the last details of the book layout, producing a translated book is so much more than just translating and proofreading, and Raphaël did (or delegated and supervised) it all. So thanks.

				Thanks also to all who more or less directly contributed to this book, by providing clarifications or explanations, or translating advice. They are too many to mention, but most of them can usually be found on various #debian-* IRC channels.

				There is of course some overlap with the previous set of people, but specific thanks are still in order for the people who actually do Debian. There wouldn't be much of a book without them, and I am still amazed at what the Debian project as a whole produces and makes available to any and all.

				More personal thanks go to my friends and my clients, for their understanding when I was less responsive because I was working on this book, and also for their constant support, encouragement and egging on. You know who you are; thanks.

				And finally; I am sure they would be surprised by being mentioned here, but I would like to extend my gratitude to Terry Pratchett, Jasper Fforde, Tom Holt, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, and of course the late Douglas Adams. The countless hours I spent enjoying their books are directly responsible for my being able to take part in translating one first and writing new parts later.
