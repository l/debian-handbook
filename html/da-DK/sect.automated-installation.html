			The Falcot Corp administrators, like many administrators of large IT services, need tools to install (or reinstall) quickly, and automatically if possible, their new machines.
		</div><div
          class="para">
			These requirements can be met by a wide range of solutions. On the one hand, generic tools such as SystemImager handle this by creating an image based on a template machine, then deploy that image to the target systems; at the other end of the spectrum, the standard Debian installer can be preseeded with a configuration file giving the answers to the questions asked during the installation process. As a sort of middle ground, a hybrid tool such as FAI (<span
            class="emphasis"><em>Fully Automatic Installer</em></span>) installs machines using the packaging system, but it also uses its own infrastructure for tasks that are more specific to massive deployments (such as starting, partitioning, configuration and so on).
		</div><div
          class="para">
			Each of these solutions has its pros and cons: SystemImager works independently from any particular packaging system, which allows it to manage large sets of machines using several distinct Linux distributions. It also includes an update system that doesn't require a reinstallation, but this update system can only be reliable if the machines are not modified independently; in other words, the user must not update any software on their own, or install any other software. Similarly, security updates must not be automated, because they have to go through the centralized reference image maintained by SystemImager. This solution also requires the target machines to be homogeneous, otherwise many different images would have to be kept and managed (an i386 image won't fit on a powerpc machine, and so on).
		</div><div
          class="para">
			On the other hand, an automated installation using debian-installer can adapt to the specifics of each machine: the installer will fetch the appropriate kernel and software packages from the relevant repositories, detect available hardware, partition the whole hard disk to take advantage of all the available space, install the corresponding Debian system, and set up an appropriate bootloader. However, the standard installer will only install standard Debian versions, with the base system and a set of pre-selected “tasks”; this precludes installing a particular system with non-packaged applications. Fulfilling this particular need requires customizing the installer… Fortunately, the installer is very modular, and there are tools to automate most of the work required for this customization, most importantly simple-CDD (CDD being an acronym for <span
            class="emphasis"><em>Custom Debian Derivative</em></span>). Even the simple-CDD solution, however, only handles initial installations; this is usually not a problem since the APT tools allow efficient deployment of updates later on.
		</div><div
          class="para">
			We will only give a rough overview of FAI, and skip SystemImager altogether (which is no longer in Debian), in order to focus more intently on debian-installer and simple-CDD, which are more interesting in a Debian-only context.

                class="foreignphrase">Fully Automatic Installer</em></span> is probably the oldest automated deployment system for Debian, which explains its status as a reference; but its very flexible nature only just compensates for the complexity it involves.
			</div><div

				FAI requires a server system to store deployment information and allow target machines to boot from the network. This server requires the <span
              class="pkg pkg">fai-server</span> package (or <span
              class="pkg pkg">fai-quickstart</span>, which also brings the required elements for a standard configuration).
			</div><div
            class="para">
				FAI uses a specific approach for defining the various installable profiles. Instead of simply duplicating a reference installation, FAI is a full-fledged installer, fully configurable via a set of files and scripts stored on the server; the default location <code
              class="filename">/srv/fai/config/</code> is not automatically created, so the administrator needs to create it along with the relevant files. Most of the times, these files will be customized from the example files available in the documentation for the <span
              class="pkg pkg">fai-doc</span> package, more particularly the <code
              class="filename">/usr/share/doc/fai-doc/examples/simple/</code> directory.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				Once the profiles are defined, the <code
              class="command">fai-setup</code> command generates the elements required to start an FAI installation; this mostly means preparing or updating a minimal system (NFS-root) used during installation. An alternative is to generate a dedicated boot CD with <code
              class="command">fai-cd</code>.
			</div><div

				At the end of the day, the best tool to install Debian systems should logically be the official Debian installer. This is why, right from its inception, debian-installer has been designed for automated use, taking advantage of the infrastructure provided by <span
              class="pkg pkg">debconf</span>. The latter allows, on the one hand, to reduce the number of questions asked (hidden questions will use the provided default answer), and on the other hand, to provide the default answers separately, so that installation can be non-interactive. This last feature is known as <span
              class="emphasis"><em>preseeding</em></span>.

				Preseeding allows to provide a set of answers to Debconf questions at installation time, but these answers are static and do not evolve as time passes. Since already-installed machines may need upgrading, and new answers may become required, the <code
                class="filename">/etc/debconf.conf</code> configuration file can be set up so that Debconf uses external data sources (such as an LDAP directory server, or a remote file accessed via NFS or Samba). Several external data sources can be defined at the same time, and they complement one another. The local database is still used (for read-write access), but the remote databases are usually restricted to reading. The <span

							in the initrd used to start the machine; in this case, preseeding happens at the very beginning of the installation, and all questions can be avoided. The file just needs to be called <code
                      class="filename">preseed.cfg</code> and stored in the initrd root.
						</div></li><li
                  class="listitem"><div
                    class="para">

                      class="literal">preseed/file</code> boot parameter can be used to indicate the location of the preseeding file (for instance, <code
                      class="filename">/cdrom/preseed.cfg</code> when the installation is done off a CD-ROM, or <code

					At a glance, including the preseeding file in the initrd looks like the most interesting solution; however, it is rarely used in practice, because generating an installer initrd is rather complex. The other two solutions are much more common, especially since boot parameters provide another way to preseed the answers to the first questions of the installation process. The usual way to save the bother of typing these boot parameters by hand at each installation is to save them into the configuration for <code
                class="command">isolinux</code> (in the CD-ROM case) or <code

However, a cleaner solution is to write the preseed file by hand, starting from an example and the reference documentation: with such an approach, only questions where the default answer needs to be overridden can be preseeded; using the <code
                class="literal">priority=critical</code> boot parameter will instruct Debconf to only ask critical questions, and use the default answer for others.

						A USB key is a read-write media, so it was easy for us to add a file there and change a few parameters. In the CD-ROM case, the operation is more complex, since we need to regenerate a full ISO image. This task is handled by <span
                  class="pkg pkg">debian-cd</span>, but this tool is rather awkward to use: it needs a local mirror, and it requires an understanding of all the options provided by <code
                  class="filename">/usr/share/debian-cd/CONF.sh</code>; even then, <code
                  class="command">make</code> must be invoked several times. <code
                  class="filename">/usr/share/debian-cd/README</code> is therefore a very recommended read.

						Having said that, debian-cd always operates in a similar way: an “image” directory with the exact contents of the CD-ROM is generated, then converted to an ISO file with a tool such as <code
                  class="command">genisoimage</code>, <code
                  class="command">mkisofs</code> or <code
                  class="command">xorriso</code>. The image directory is finalized after debian-cd's <code
                  class="command">make image-trees</code> step. At that point, we insert the preseed file into the appropriate directory (usually <code
                  class="filename">$TDIR/wheezy/CD1/</code>, $TDIR being one of the parameters defined by the <code
                  class="filename">CONF.sh</code> configuration file). The CD-ROM uses <code
                  class="command">isolinux</code> as its bootloader, and its configuration file must be adapted from what debian-cd generated, in order to insert the required boot parameters (the specific file is <code
                  class="filename">$TDIR/wheezy/boot1/isolinux/isolinux.cfg</code>). Then the “normal” process can be resumed, and we can go on to generating the ISO image with <code
                  class="command">make image CD=1</code> (or <code
                  class="command">make images</code> if several CD-ROMs are generated).

				Simply using a preseed file is not enough to fulfill all the requirements that may appear for large deployments. Even though it is possible to execute a few scripts at the end of the normal installation process, the selection of the set of packages to install is still not quite flexible (basically, only “tasks” can be selected); more important, this only allows installing official Debian packages, and precludes locally-generated ones.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				On the other hand, debian-cd is able to integrate external packages, and debian-installer can be extended by inserting new steps in the installation process. By combining these capabilities, it should be possible to create a customized installer that fulfills our needs; it should even be able to configure some services after unpacking the required packages. Fortunately, this is not a mere hypothesis, since this is exactly what Simple-CDD (in the <span

				The purpose of Simple-CDD is to allow anyone to easily create a distribution derived from Debian, by selecting a subset of the available packages, preconfiguring them with Debconf, adding specific software, and executing custom scripts at the end of the installation process. This matches the “universal operating system” philosophy, since anyone can adapt it to their own needs.
