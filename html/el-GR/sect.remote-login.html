If the private key was not protected with a “passphrase” at the time of its creation, all subsequent logins on the server will work without a password. Otherwise, the private key must be decrypted each time by entering the passphrase. Fortunately, <code

					The OpenSSL library, as initially provided in Debian <span

                  class="command">valgrind</code>. Unfortunately, this change also meant that the RNG was employing only one source of entropy corresponding to the process number (PID) whose 32,000 possible values do not offer enough randomness. <div

					Specifically, whenever OpenSSL was used to generate a key, it always produced a key within a known set of hundreds of thousands of keys (32,000 multiplied by a small number of key lengths). This affected SSH keys, SSL keys, and X.509 certificates used by numerous applications, such as OpenVPN. A cracker had only to try all of the keys to gain unauthorized access. To reduce the impact of the problem, the SSH daemon was modified to refuse problematic keys that are listed in the <span
                  class="pkg pkg">openssh-blacklist</span> and <span
                  class="pkg pkg">openssh-blacklist-extra</span> packages. Additionally, the <code

				</div><div
                class="para">
					A more thorough analysis of this incident brings to light that it is the result of multiple (small) problems, both within the OpenSSL project and with the Debian package maintainer. A widely used library like OpenSSL should — without modifications — not generate warnings when tested by <code
                  class="command">valgrind</code>. Furthermore, the code (especially the parts as sensitive as the RNG) should be better commented to prevent such errors. On Debian's side, the maintainer wanted to validate the modifications with the OpenSSL developers, but simply explained the modifications without providing the corresponding patch to review and failed to mention his role within Debian. Finally, the maintenance choices were sub-optimal: the changes made to the original code were not clearly documented; all the modifications were effectively stored in a Subversion repository, but they ended up all lumped into one single patch during creation of the source package.
				</div><div
                class="para">
					It is difficult under such conditions to find the corrective measures to prevent such incidents from recurring. The lesson to be learned here is that every divergence Debian introduces to upstream software must be justified, documented, submitted to the upstream project when possible, and widely publicized. It is from this perspective that the new source package format (“3.0 (quilt)”) and the Debian patch tracker were developed. <div

				If you want to connect by VNC, and you don't want your data sent in clear text on the network, it is possible to encapsulate the data in an SSH tunnel (see <a

                href="sect.remote-login.html#sect.ssh-port-forwarding">Τμήμα 9.2.1.3, «Creating Encrypted Tunnels with Port Forwarding»</a>). You simply have to know that VNC uses port 5900 by default for the first screen (called “localhost:0”), 5901 for the second (called “localhost:1”), etc.

				VNC also works for mobile users, or company executives, who occasionally need to login from their home to access a remote desktop similar to the one they use at work. The configuration of such a service is more complicated: you first install the <span

              class="literal">XDMCP Query</code> requests (for <code

              class="filename">/etc/gdm3/daemon.conf</code>), and finally, start the VNC server with <code
              class="command">inetd</code> so that a session is automatically started when a user tries to login. For example, you may add this line to <code
              class="filename">/etc/inetd.conf</code>:

				Redirecting incoming connections to the display manager solves the problem of authentication, because only users with local accounts will pass the <code
              class="command">gdm3</code> login screen (or equivalent <code
              class="command">kdm</code>, <code
              class="command">xdm</code>, etc.). As this operation allows multiple simultaneous logins without any problem (provided the server is powerful enough), it can even be used to provide complete desktops for mobile users (or for less powerful desktop systems, configured as thin clients). Users simply login to the server's screen with <code
              class="command">vncviewer <em
                class="replaceable">server</em>:50</code>, because the port used is 5950.
