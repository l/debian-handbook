				When you want to configure an unknown package, you must proceed in stages. First, you should read what the package maintainer has documented. Reading <code
              class="filename">/usr/share/doc/<em
                class="replaceable">package</em>/README.Debian</code> will indeed allow you to learn of specific provisions made to simplify the use of the software. It is sometimes essential in order to understand the differences from the original behavior of the program, as described in the general documentation, such as howtos. Sometimes this file also details the most common errors in order for you to avoid wasting time on common problems.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				Then, you should look at the software's official documentation — refer to the previous section to identify the various existing documentation sources. The <code
              class="command">dpkg -L <em
                class="replaceable">package</em></code> command gives a list of files included in the package; you can therefore quickly identify the available documentation (as well as the configuration files, located in <code
              class="filename">/etc/</code>). <code
              class="command">dpkg -s <em
                class="replaceable">package</em></code> displays the package meta-data and shows any possible recommended or suggested packages; in there, you can find documentation or a utility that will ease the configuration of the software.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				Finally, the configuration files are often self-documented by many explanatory comments detailing the various possible values for each configuration setting. So much so that it is sometimes enough to just choose a line to activate from among those available. In some cases, examples of configuration files are provided in the <code
              class="filename">/usr/share/doc/<em
                class="replaceable">package</em>/examples/</code> directory. They may serve as a basis for your own configuration file.

            class="para">
				Understanding what a daemon does is somewhat more complicated, since it does not interact directly with the administrator. To check that a daemon is actually working, you need to test it. For example, to check the Apache (web server) daemon, test it with an HTTP request.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				To allow such tests, each daemon generally records everything that it does, as well as any errors that it encounters, in what are called “log files” or “system logs”. Logs are stored in <code
              class="filename">/var/log/</code> or one of its subdirectories. To know the precise name of a log file for each daemon, see its documentation. Note: a single test is not always sufficient if it does not cover all the possible usage cases; some problems only occur in particular circumstances.

				<code

                class="command">rsyslogd</code> processes these two pieces of information to decide on what to do. The log message may be recorded in various log files, and/or sent to an administration console. The details are defined in the <code

				A daemon is a program that is not explicitly invoked by the user and that stays in the background, waiting for a certain condition to be met before performing a task. Many server programs are daemons, a term that explains that the letter “d” is frequently present at the end of their name (<code

				As a preventive operation, the administrator should regularly read the most relevant server logs. They can thus diagnose problems before they are even reported by disgruntled users. Indeed users may sometimes wait for a problem to occur repeatedly over several days before reporting it. In many cases, there are specific tools to analyze the contents of the larger log files. In particular, such utilities exist for web servers (such as <code
              class="command">analog</code>, <code
              class="command">awstats</code>, <code
              class="command">webalizer</code> for Apache), for FTP servers, for proxy/cache servers, for firewalls, for e-mail servers, for DNS servers, and even for print servers. Some of these utilities operate in a modular manner and allow analysis of several types of log files. This is the case of <code
              class="command">lire</code> or also <code
              class="command">modlogan</code>. Other tools, such as <code
              class="command">logcheck</code> (a software discussed in <a

				If all of your efforts to resolve a problem fail, it is possible that a resolution is not your responsibility, and that the problem is due to a bug in the program. In this case, the proper procedure is to report the bug to Debian or directly to the upstream developers. To do this, isolate the problem as much as possible and create a minimal test situation in which it can be reproduced. If you know which program is the apparent cause of the problem, you can find its corresponding package using the command, <code
              class="command">dpkg -S <em
                class="replaceable">file_in_question</em></code>. Check the Bug Tracking System (<code
