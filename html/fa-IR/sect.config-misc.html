				A symbolic link is a pointer to another file. When you access it, the file to which it points is opened. Removal of the link will not cause deletion of the file to which it points. Likewise, it does not have its own set of permissions, but rather retains the permissions of its target.

				There are two time sources in a computer. A computer's motherboard has a hardware clock, called the “CMOS clock”. This clock is not very precise, and provides rather slow access times. The operating system kernel has its own, the software clock, which it keeps up to date with its own means (possibly with the help of time servers, see <a
                class="xref"
                href="sect.config-misc.html#sect.time-synchronization">
      قسمت 8.9.2, “Time Synchronization”
    </a>). This system clock is generally more accurate, especially since it doesn't need access to hardware variables. However, since it only exists in live memory, it is zeroed out every time the machine is booted, contrary to the CMOS clock, which has a battery and therefore “survives” rebooting or halting of the machine. The system clock is, thus, set from the CMOS clock during boot, and the CMOS clock is updated on shutdown (to take into account possible changes or corrections if it has been improperly adjusted).
			</div><div
              class="para">
				In practice, there is a problem, since the CMOS clock is nothing more than a counter and contains no information regarding the time zone. There is a choice to make regarding its interpretation: either the system considers it runs in universal time (UTC, formerly GMT), or in local time. This choice could be a simple shift, but things are actually more complicated: as a result of daylight saving time, this offset is not constant. The result is that the system has no way to determine whether the offset is correct, especially around periods of time change. Since it is always possible to reconstruct local time from universal time and the timezone information, we strongly recommend using the CMOS clock in universal time.
			</div><div
              class="para">
				Unfortunately, Windows systems in their default configuration ignore this recommendation; they keep the CMOS clock on local time, applying time changes when booting the computer by trying to guess during time changes if the change has already been applied or not. This works relatively well, as long as the system has only Windows running on it. But when a computer has several systems (whether it be a “dual-boot” configuration or running other systems via virtual machine), chaos ensues, with no means to determine if the time is correct. If you absolutely must retain Windows on a computer, you should either configure it to keep the CMOS clock as UTC (setting the registry key <code
                class="literal">HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation\RealTimeIsUniversal</code> to “1” as a DWORD), or use <code
                class="command">hwclock --localtime --set</code> on the Debian system to set the hardware clock and mark it as tracking the local time (and make sure to manually check your clock in spring and autumn).

				Time synchronization, which may seem superfluous on a computer, is very important on a network. Since users do not have permissions allowing them to modify the date and time, it is important for this information to be precise to prevent confusion. Furthermore, having all of the computers on a network synchronized allows better cross-referencing of information from logs on different machines. Thus, in the event of an attack, it is easier to reconstruct the chronological sequence of actions on the various machines involved in the compromise. Data collected on several machines for statistical purposes won't make a great deal of sense if they are not synchronized.

				While there are numerous NTP servers on the Internet, the more popular ones may be overloaded. This is why we recommend using the <span

			</div><div
              class="para">
				However, if you manage a large network, it is recommended that you install your own NTP server, which will synchronize with the public servers. In this case, all the other machines on your network can use your internal NTP server instead of increasing the load on the public servers. You will also increase homogeneity with your clocks, since all the machines will be synchronized on the same source, and this source is very close in terms of network transfer times.

				In a Unix-like system such as Debian, files are organized in a single tree-like hierarchy of directories. The <code
                class="filename">/</code> directory is called the “root directory”; all additional directories are sub-directories within this root. “Mounting” is the action of including the content of a peripheral device (often a hard drive) into the system's general file tree. As a consequence, if you use a separate hard drive to store users' personal data, this disk will have to be “mounted” in the <code
                class="filename">/home/</code> directory. The root filesystem is always mounted at boot by the kernel; other devices are often mounted later during the startup sequence or manually with the <code
                class="command">mount</code> command.
