			Several tools provide this. OpenVPN is an efficient solution, easy to deploy and maintain, based on SSL/TLS. Another possibility is using IPsec to encrypt IP traffic between two machines; this encryption is transparent, which means that applications running on these hosts need not be modified to take the VPN into account. SSH can also be used to provide a VPN, in addition to its more conventional features. Finally, a VPN can be established using Microsoft's PPTP protocol. Other solutions exist, but are beyond the focus of this book.

				OpenVPN is a piece of software dedicated to creating virtual private networks. Its setup involves creating virtual network interfaces on the VPN server and on the client(s); both <code

				OpenVPN relies on OpenSSL for all the SSL/TLS cryptography and associated features (confidentiality, authentication, integrity, non-repudiation). It can be configured either with a shared private key or using X.509 certificates based on a public key infrastructure. The latter configuration is strongly preferred since it allows greater flexibility when faced with a growing number of roaming users accessing the VPN.

					The RSA algorithm is widely used in public-key cryptography. It involves a “key pair”, comprised of a private and a public key. The two keys are closely linked to each other, and their mathematical properties are such that a message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by someone knowing the private key, which ensures confidentiality. In the opposite direction, a message encrypted with the private key can be decrypted by anyone knowing the public key, which allows authenticating the origin of a message since only someone with access to the private key could generate it. When associated with a digital hash function (MD5, SHA1, or a more recent variant), this leads to a signature mechanism that can be applied to any message.

This certificate is only used to sign other certificates (key pairs), after proper steps have been undertaken to check the identity stored on the key pair. Applications using X.509 can then check the certificates presented to them, if they know about the trusted root certificates.

This allows the configuration of all clients to be similar since they will only have to be set up so as to trust certificates coming from Falcot's local CA. This CA is the first certificate to create; to this end, the administrators set up a directory with the files required for the CA in an appropriate location, preferably on a machine not connected to the network in order to mitigate the risk of the CA's private key being stolen.

					With this configuration, starting OpenVPN creates the virtual network interface, usually under the <code
                class="literal">tun0</code> name. However, firewalls are often configured at the same time as the real network interfaces, which happens before OpenVPN starts. Good practice therefore recommends creating a persistent virtual network interface, and configuring OpenVPN to use this pre-existing interface. This further allows choosing the name for this interface. To this end, <code
                class="command">openvpn --mktun --dev vpn --dev-type tun</code> creates a virtual network interface named <code

Furthermore, machines on the local network also need to be informed that the route to the VPN goes through the VPN server (this automatically works when the VPN server is installed on the gateway).

				There are actually two ways of creating a virtual private network with SSH. The historic one involves establishing a PPP layer over the SSH link. This method is described in a HOWTO document: <div
              class="url">→ <a
                href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/ppp-ssh/">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/ppp-ssh/</a></div>
			</div><div
            class="para">
				The second method is more recent, and was introduced with OpenSSH 4.3; it is now possible for OpenSSH to create virtual network interfaces (<code
              class="literal">tun*</code>) on both sides of an SSH connection, and these virtual interfaces can be configured exactly as if they were physical interfaces. The tunneling system must first be enabled by setting <code
              class="literal">PermitTunnel</code> to “yes” in the SSH server configuration file (<code
              class="filename">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>). When establishing the SSH connection, the creation of a tunnel must be explicitly requested with the <code
              class="literal">-w any:any</code> option (<code
              class="literal">any</code> can be replaced with the desired <code
              class="literal">tun</code> device number). This requires the user to have administrator privilege on both sides, so as to be able to create the network device (in other words, the connection must be established as root).
			</div><div
            class="para">
				Both methods for creating a virtual private network over SSH are quite straightforward. However, the VPN they provide is not the most efficient available; in particular, it does not handle high levels of traffic very well.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				The explanation is that when a TCP/IP stack is encapsulated within a TCP/IP connection (for SSH), the TCP protocol is used twice, once for the SSH connection and once within the tunnel. This leads to problems, especially due to the way TCP adapts to network conditions by altering timeout delays. The following site describes the problem in more detail: <div
              class="url">→ <a
                href="http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html">http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html</a></div> VPNs over SSH should therefore be restricted to one-off tunnels with no performance constraints.

# TAG: localip
# TAG: remoteip
#
#       Specifies the local and remote IP address ranges.
#
#       You can specify single IP addresses separated by commas or you can
#       specify ranges, or both. For example:
#
#               192.168.0.234,192.168.0.245-249,192.168.0.254
#
#       IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS:
#
#       1. No spaces are permitted between commas or within addresses.
#
#       2. If you give more IP addresses than MAX_CONNECTIONS, it will
#          start at the beginning of the list and go until it gets
#          MAX_CONNECTIONS IPs. Others will be ignored.
#
#       3. No shortcuts in ranges! ie. 234-8 does not mean 234 to 238,
#          you must type 234-238 if you mean this.
#
#       4. If you give a single localIP, that's ok - all local IPs will
#          be set to the given one. You MUST still give at least one remote
#          IP for each simultaneous client.
#
#localip 192.168.0.234-238,192.168.0.245
#remoteip 192.168.1.234-238,192.168.1.245
#localip 10.0.1.1
#remoteip 10.0.1.2-100
localip 192.168.0.199
remoteip 192.168.0.200-250

					The last step involves registering the <code

                class="literal">*</code>) would work, the server name must be filled explicitly here. Furthermore, Windows PPTP clients identify themselves under the <code

                  class="replaceable">DOMAIN</em>\\<em
                  class="replaceable">USER</em></code> form, instead of only providing a user name. This explains why the file also mentions the <code
                class="literal">FALCOT\\vpn</code> user. It is also possible to specify individual IP addresses for users; an asterisk in this field specifies that dynamic addressing should be used.

					Microsoft's first PPTP implementation drew severe criticism because it had many security vulnerabilities; most have since then been fixed in more recent versions. The configuration documented in this section uses the latest version of the protocol. Be aware though that removing some options (such as <code
