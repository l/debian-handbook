				The <code
              class="filename">sources.list</code> file is often a good indicator: the majority of administrators keep, at least in comments, the list of APT sources that were previously used. But you should not forget that sources used in the past might have been deleted, and that some random packages grabbed on the Internet might have been manually installed (with the <code
              class="command">dpkg</code> command). In this case, the machine is misleading in its appearance of “standard” Debian. This is why you should pay attention to any indication that will give away the presence of external packages (appearance of <code
              class="filename">deb</code> files in unusual directories, package version numbers with a special suffix indicating that it originated from outside the Debian project, such as <code
