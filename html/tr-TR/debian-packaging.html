		It is quite common, for an administrator who has been handling Debian packages in a regular fashion, to eventually feel the need to create their own packages, or to modify an existing package. This chapter aims to answer the most common questions in this field, and provide the required elements to take advantage of the Debian infrastructure in the best way. With any luck, after trying your hand for local packages, you may even feel the need to go further than that and join the Debian project itself!

            class="para">
			Rebuilding a binary package is required under several sets of circumstances. In some cases, the administrator needs a software feature that requires the software to be compiled from sources, with a particular compilation option; in others, the software as packaged in the installed version of Debian is not recent enough. In the latter case, the administrator will usually build a more recent package taken from a newer version of Debian — such as <span
              class="distribution distribution">Testing</span> or even <span
              class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span> — so that this new package works in their <span
              class="distribution distribution">Stable</span> distribution; this operation is called “backporting”. As usual, care should be taken, before undertaking such a task, to check whether it has been done already — a quick look on the Package Tracking System's page for that package will reveal that information. <div

              class="para">
				Rebuilding a Debian package starts with getting its source code. The easiest way is to use the <code
                class="command">apt-get source <em
                  class="replaceable">source-package-name</em></code> command. This command requires a <code
                class="literal">deb-src</code> line in the <code
                class="filename">/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file, and up-to-date index files (i.e. <code
                class="command">apt-get update</code>). These conditions should already be met if you followed the instructions from the chapter dealing with APT configuration (see <a
                class="xref"
                href="apt.html#sect.apt-sources.list">Kısım 6.1, “Filling in the <code
                  class="filename">sources.list</code> File”</a>). Note however, that you'll be downloading the source packages from the Debian version mentioned in the <code
                class="literal">deb-src</code> line. If you need another version, you may need to download it manually from a Debian mirror or from the web site. This involves fetching two or three files (with extensions <code
                class="filename">*.dsc</code> — for <span
                class="emphasis"><em>Debian Source Control</em></span> — <code
                class="filename">*.tar.<em
                  class="replaceable">comp</em></code>, and sometimes <code
                class="filename">*.diff.gz</code> or <code
                class="filename">*.debian.tar.<em
                  class="replaceable">comp</em></code> — <em
                class="replaceable">comp</em> taking one value among <code
                class="literal">gz</code>, <code
                class="literal">bz2</code>, <code
                class="literal">lzma</code> or <code
                class="literal">xz</code> depending on the compression tool in use), then run the <code
                class="command">dpkg-source -x <em
                  class="replaceable">file.dsc</em></code> command. If the <code
                class="filename">*.dsc</code> file is directly accessible at a given URL, there's an even simpler way to fetch it all, with the <code
                class="command">dget <em
                  class="replaceable">URL</em></code> command. This command (which can be found in the <span
                class="pkg pkg">devscripts</span> package) fetches the <code
                class="filename">*.dsc</code> file at the given address, then analyzes its contents, and automatically fetches the file or files referenced within. With the <code
                class="literal">-x</code> option, the source package is even unpacked locally after download.

				The source of the package is now available in a directory named after the source package and its version (for instance, <span
                class="emphasis"><em>samba-3.6.16</em></span>); this is where we'll work on our local changes.
			</div><div
              class="para">
				The first thing to do is to change the package version number, so that the rebuilt packages can be distinguished from the original packages provided by Debian. Assuming the current version is <code
                class="literal">3.6.16-2</code>, we can create version <code
                class="literal">3.6.16-2falcot1</code>, which clearly indicates the origin of the package. This makes the package version number higher than the one provided by Debian, so that the package will easily install as an update do the original package. Such a change is best effected with the <code
                class="command">dch</code> command (<span
                class="emphasis"><em>Debian CHangelog</em></span>) from the <span
                class="pkg pkg">devscripts</span> package, with an command such as <code
                class="command">dch --local falcot</code>. This invokes a text editor (<code
                class="command">sensible-editor</code> — this should be your favorite editor if it's mentioned in the <code
                class="varname">VISUAL</code> or <code
                class="varname">EDITOR</code> environment variables, and the default editor otherwise) to allow documenting the differences brought by this rebuild. This editor shows us that <code
                class="command">dch</code> really did change the <code
                class="filename">debian/changelog</code> file.
			</div><div
              class="para">
				When a change in build options is required, the changes need to be made in <code
                class="filename">debian/rules</code>, which drives the steps in the package build process. In the simplest cases, the lines concerning the initial configuration (<code
                class="literal">./configure …</code>) or the actual build (<code
                class="literal">$(MAKE) …</code> or <code
                class="literal">make …</code>) are easy to spot. If these commands are not explicitly called, they are probably a side effect of another explicit command, in which case please refer to their documentation to learn more about how to change the default behavior.
			</div><div
              class="para">
				Depending on the local changes to the packages, an update may also be required in the <code
                class="filename">debian/control</code> file, which contains a description of the generated packages. In particular, this file contains <code
                class="literal">Build-Depends</code> lines controlling the list of dependencies that must be fulfilled at package build time. These often refer to versions of packages contained in the distribution the source package comes from, but which may not be available in the distribution used for the rebuild. There is no automated way to determine if a dependency is real or only specified to guarantee that the build should only be attempted with the latest version of a library — this is the only available way to force an <span
                class="emphasis"><em>autobuilder</em></span> to use a given package version during build, which is why Debian maintainers frequently use strictly versioned build-dependencies.
			</div><div
              class="para">
				If you know for sure that these build-dependencies are too strict, you should feel free to relax them locally. Reading the files which document the standard way of building the software — these files are often called <code
                class="filename">INSTALL</code> — will help you figure out the appropriate dependencies. Ideally, all dependencies should be satisfiable from the distribution used for the rebuild; if they are not, a recursive process starts, whereby the packages mentioned in the <code
                class="literal">Build-Depends</code> field must be backported before the target package can be. Some packages may not need backporting, and can be installed as-is during the build process (a notable example is <span
                class="pkg pkg">debhelper</span>). Note that the backporting process can quickly become complex if you are not careful. Therefore, backports should be kept to a strict minimum when possible.

				In essence, the package creation process is a simple matter of gathering in an archive a set of existing (or built) files; most of the files will end up being owned by <span

When the program creates the archive that will become the Debian package, it is tricked into creating an archive containing files marked as belonging to arbitrary owners, including <span

                  class="command">dpkg-buildpackage</code> uses <code

				The <code
                  class="command">pbuilder</code> program (in the similarly named package) allows building a Debian package in a <span
                  class="emphasis"><em>chrooted</em></span> environment. It first creates a temporary directory containing the minimal system required for building the package (including the packages mentioned in the <span
                  class="emphasis"><em>Build-Depends</em></span> field). This directory is then used as the root directory (<code
                  class="filename">/</code>), using the <code
                  class="command">chroot</code> command, during the build process.

				This tool allows the build process to happen in an environment that is not altered by users' manipulations. This also allows for quick detection of the missing build-dependencies (since the build will fail unless the appropriate dependencies are documented). Finally, it allows building a package for a Debian version that is not the one used by the system as a whole: the machine can be using <span
                  class="distribution distribution">Stable</span> for its normal workload, and a <code
                  class="command">pbuilder</code> running on the same machine can be using <span
                  class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span> for package builds.
