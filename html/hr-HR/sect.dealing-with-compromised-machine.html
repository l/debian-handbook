				The first step of reacting to cracking is to be aware of such an act. This is not self-evident, especially without an adequate monitoring infrastructure.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				Cracking acts are often not detected until they have direct consequences on the legitimate services hosted on the machine, such as connections slowing down, some users being unable to connect, or any other kind of malfunction. Faced with these problems, the administrator needs to have a good look at the machine and carefully scrutinize what misbehaves. This is usually the time when they discover an unusual process, for instance one named <code
              class="literal">apache</code> instead of the standard <code
              class="literal">/usr/sbin/apache2</code>. If we follow that example, the thing to do is to note its process identifier, and check <code
              class="filename">/proc/<em
                class="replaceable">pid</em>/exe</code> to see what program this process is currently running:
			</div><pre

            class="para">
				In any but the most exotic cases, the cracking comes from the network, and the attacker needs a working network to reach their targets (access confidential data, share illegal files, hide their identity by using the machine as a relay, and so on). Unplugging the computer from the network will prevent the attacker from reaching these targets, if they haven't managed to do so yet.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				This may only be possible if the server is physically accessible. When the server is hosted in a hosting provider's data center halfway across the country, or if the server is not accessible for any other reason, it's usually a good idea to start by gathering some important information (see following sections), then isolating that server as much as possible by shutting down as many services as possible (usually, everything but <code
              class="command">sshd</code>). This case is still awkward, since one can't rule out the possibility of the attacker having SSH access like the administrator has; this makes it harder to “clean” the machines.

            class="para">
				Understanding the attack and/or engaging legal action against the attackers requires taking copies of all the important elements; this includes the contents of the hard disk, a list of all running processes, and a list of all open connections. The contents of the RAM could also be used, but it is rarely used in practice.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				In the heat of action, administrators are often tempted to perform many checks on the compromised machine; this is usually not a good idea. Every command is potentially subverted and can erase pieces of evidence. The checks should be restricted to the minimal set (<code
              class="command">netstat -tupan</code> for network connections, <code
              class="command">ps auxf</code> for a list of processes, <code
              class="command">ls -alR /proc/[0-9]*</code> for a little more information on running programs), and every performed check should carefully be written down.

              class="para">
				While it may seem tempting to analyze the system as it runs, especially when the server is not physically reachable, this is best avoided: quite simply you can't trust the programs currently installed on the compromised system. It's quite possible for a subverted <code
                class="command">ps</code> command to hide some processes, or for a subverted <code
                class="command">ls</code> to hide files; sometimes even the kernel is compromised!
			</div><div
              class="para">
				If such a hot analysis is still required, care should be taken to only use known-good programs. A good way to do that would be to have a rescue CD with pristine programs, or a read-only network share. However, even those countermeasures may not be enough if the kernel itself is compromised.
			</div></div><div
            class="para">
				Once the “dynamic” elements have been saved, the next step is to store a complete image of the hard-disk. Making such an image is impossible if the filesystem is still evolving, which is why it must be remounted read-only. The simplest solution is often to halt the server brutally (after running <code
              class="command">sync</code>) and reboot it on a rescue CD. Each partition should be copied with a tool such as <code
              class="command">dd</code>; these images can be sent to another server (possibly with the very convenient <code
              class="command">nc</code> tool). Another possibility may be even simpler: just get the disk out of the machine and replace it with a new one that can be reformatted and reinstalled.

				The server should not be brought back on line without a complete reinstallation. If the compromise was severe (if administrative privileges were obtained), there is almost no other way to be sure that we're rid of everything the attacker may have left behind (particularly <span
              class="emphasis"><em>backdoors</em></span>). Of course, all the latest security updates must also be applied so as to plug the vulnerability used by the attacker. Ideally, analyzing the attack should point at this attack vector, so one can be sure of actually fixing it; otherwise, one can only hope that the vulnerability was one of those fixed by the updates.
			</div><div
            class="para">
				Reinstalling a remote server is not always easy; it may involve assistance from the hosting company, because not all such companies provide automated reinstallation systems. Care should be taken not to reinstall the machine from backups taken later than the compromise. Ideally, only data should be restored, the actual software should be reinstalled from the installation media.

				Now that the service has been restored, it is time to have a closer look at the disk images of the compromised system in order to understand the attack vector. When mounting these images, care should be taken to use the <code

				In parallel, the attacker also downloaded a pair of extra files, <code
              class="filename">/tmp/pt</code> and <code
              class="filename">/tmp/loginx</code>. Running these files through <code
              class="command">strings</code> leads to strings such as <span
              class="foreignphrase"><em
                class="foreignphrase">Shellcode placed at 0x%08lx</em></span> and <span
              class="foreignphrase"><em
                class="foreignphrase">Now wait for suid shell...</em></span>. These look like programs exploiting local vulnerabilities to obtain administrative privileges. Did they reach their target? In this case, probably not, since no files seem to have been modified after the initial breach.

				In this example, the whole intrusion has been reconstructed, and it can be deduced that the attacker has been able to take advantage of the compromised system for about three days; but the most important element in the analysis is that the vulnerability has been identified, and the administrator can be sure that the new installation really does fix the vulnerability.
