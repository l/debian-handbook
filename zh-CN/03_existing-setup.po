msgid "Analyzing the Existing Setup and Migrating"
msgstr "分析当前设置与迁移"

msgid "Any computer system overhaul should take the existing system into account. This allows reuse of available resources as much as possible and guarantees interoperability of the various elements comprising the system. This study will introduce a generic framework to follow in any migration of a computing infrastructure to Linux."
msgstr "任何系统的彻底修检都应考虑到已有的系统。其中包括让尽可能多的资源复用，和保证组成系统的各个部分协调无碍。以下的学习案列会介绍一个将设备向 Linux 迁移的通用技术框架。"

msgid "Coexistence in Heterogeneous Environments"
msgstr "在异构环境中共存"

msgid "<primary>environment</primary><secondary>heterogeneous environment</secondary>"
msgstr "<primary>环境</primary><secondary>异构环境</secondary>"

msgid "Debian integrates very well in all types of existing environments and plays well with any other operating system. This near-perfect harmony comes from market pressure which demands that software publishers develop programs that follow standards. Compliance with standards allows administrators to switch out programs: clients or servers, whether free or not."
msgstr "Debian能和已存的环境整合无碍，并和其他操作系统共存。这近乎完美的和谐来自市场的压力：市场要求软件发布者需要遵从一定的标准。接受这些标准让管理员能灵活替换各种程序，客户端或服务端，免费与否，都不是问题。"

msgid "Integration with Windows Machines"
msgstr "和Windows机器整合"

msgid "Samba's SMB/CIFS support ensures excellent communication within a Windows context. It shares files and print queues to Windows clients and includes software that allow a Linux machine to use resources available on Windows servers."
msgstr "Samba提供的SMB/CIFS支持确保了在Windows占多数的场景下也能无缝通信。它可以将文件和打印队列分享给Windows客户端，并包含了一些软件，使得Linux机器也能使用Windows服务器所提供的服务。"

msgid "<emphasis>TOOL</emphasis> Samba"
msgstr "<emphasis>工具</emphasis> Samba"

msgstr "<primary>Samba</primary>"

msgid "The latest version of Samba can replace most of the Windows features: from those of a simple Windows NT server (authentication, files, print queues, downloading printer drivers, DFS, etc.) to the most advanced one (a domain controller compatible with Active Directory)."
msgstr "最新版本的Samba可以替换Windows的大多数功能：它可以模拟成一个简单的Windows NT服务器开展工作（包括验证、文件分享、打印队列、下载打印机启动、分布式文件系统（DFS），等等），也可以支持一些最高级的服务功能（例如，作为与Active Directory兼容的域控制器工作）。"

msgid "Integration with OS X machines"
msgstr "和OS X机器整合"

msgid "OS X machines provide, and are able to use, network services such as file servers and printer sharing. These services are published on the local network, which allows other machines to discover them and make use of them without any manual configuration, using the Bonjour implementation of the Zeroconf protocol suite. Debian includes another implementation, called Avahi, which provides the same functionality."
msgstr "OS X 机器能够提供的网络服务包括文件共享及打印机共享。这些服务在本地网络中使用 Zereconf 协议套件进行发布，并允许其他机器在没有手动配置的情况下自动发现设备。Debian 包括另外一个名为 Avahi 的实现，提供类似的服务。"

msgid "<primary>AFP</primary>"

msgid "<primary>AppleShare</primary>"
msgstr "<primary>AppleShare</primary>"

msgid "In the other direction, the Netatalk daemon can be used to provide file servers to OS X machines on the network. It implements the AFP (AppleShare) protocol as well as the required notifications so that the servers can be autodiscovered by the OS X clients."
msgstr "从另外方向看， Netatalk 服务可用于在 OS X 机器上提供文件共享服务。它使用 AFP（AppleShare） 协议作为依赖素以该服务能被客户端自动发现。"

msgid "<primary>AppleTalk</primary>"
msgstr "<primary>AppleTalk</primary>"

#, fuzzy
msgid "Older Mac OS networks (before OS X) used a different protocol called AppleTalk. For environments involving machines using this protocol, Netatalk also provides the AppleTalk protocol (in fact, it started as a reimplementation of that protocol). It ensures the operation of the file server and print queues, as well as time server (clock synchronization). Its router function allows interconnection with AppleTalk networks."
msgstr "OS X 之前的 Mac OS 网络使用一个叫 AppleTalk 的协议。使用该协议的环境， Netatalk 也提供 AppleTalk 协议（事实上是重新实现了该协议）。它保证文件服务、打印队列以及时间同步服务。它的路由器支持 AppleTalk 的网络通讯。"

msgid "Integration with Other Linux/Unix Machines"
msgstr "与其他 Linux/Unix 设备集成"

#, fuzzy
msgid "Finally, NFS and NIS, both included, guarantee interaction with Unix systems. NFS ensures file server functionality, while NIS creates user directories. The BSD printing layer, used by most Unix systems, also allows sharing of print queues."
msgstr "最后， NFS 和 NIS 保证机器与 Unix 系统的互动。NFS 提供文件共享服务功能，NIS 创建用户目录。多数 Unix 系统 使用到的 BSD 打印层，提供共享打印队列"

msgid "Coexistence of Debian with OS X, Windows and Unix systems"

msgid "How To Migrate"
msgstr "如何迁移"

msgid "<primary>migration</primary>"
msgstr "<primary>迁移</primary>"

#, fuzzy
msgid "In order to guarantee continuity of the services, each computer migration must be planned and executed according to the plan. This principle applies whatever the operating system used."
msgstr "为了确保后续服务，每个计算机迁移都必须规划并按计划执行。任何操作系统都适用这个原则。"

msgid "Survey and Identify Services"
msgstr "流行度调查和身份识别服务"

msgid "As simple as it seems, this step is essential. A serious administrator truly knows the principal roles of each server, but such roles can change, and sometimes experienced users may have installed “wild” services. Knowing that they exist will at least allow you to decide what to do with them, rather than delete them haphazardly."
msgstr "如你看到的，该步骤是必要的。一个严谨的管理员应当确切的知道每部服务器的确切角色，但是角色可以被改变，有时候有经验的用户会安装一些服务。了解这些服务的功能让你知道如何处理它，而不是粗暴的删除它们。"

#, fuzzy
msgid "For this purpose, it is wise to inform your users of the project before migrating the server. To involve them in the project, it may be useful to install the most common free software programs on their desktops prior to migration, which they will come across again after the migration to Debian; Libre Office and the Mozilla suite are the best examples here."
msgstr "基于以上目的，迁移服务器前告知参与计划的使用者是明智之举。邀请他们进入计划中，迁移至Debian前安装常用的自由软件到他们的桌面以供体验；Libre Office 和 Mozilla 套件是最好的例子。"

These include the <command>nmap</command> and <command>netstat</command> commands, but also others, such as <command>route</command> or <command>ip</command>. The convention is that this behavior is enabled by the <parameter>-6</parameter> command-line option."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the server is a Unix machine offering shell accounts to users, it is interesting to determine if processes are executed in the background in the absence of their owner. The command <command>ps auxw</command> displays a list of all processes with their user identity. By checking this information against the output of the <command>who</command> command, which gives a list of logged in users, it is possible to identify rogue or undeclared servers or programs running in the background. Looking at <filename>crontabs</filename> (tables listing automatic actions scheduled by users) will often provide interesting information on functions fulfilled by the server (a complete explanation of <command>cron</command> is available in <xref linkend=\"sect.task-scheduling-cron-atd\" />)."
msgstr ""

msgid "In any case, it is essential to backup your servers: this allows recovery of information after the fact, when users will report specific problems due to the migration."
msgstr ""

msgid "Backing up the Configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is wise to retain the configuration of every identified service in order to be able to install the equivalent on the updated server. The bare minimum is to make a backup copy of the configuration files."
msgstr ""

msgid "For Unix machines, the configuration files are usually found in <filename>/etc/</filename>, but they may be located in a sub-directory of <filename>/usr/local/</filename>. This is the case if a program has been installed from sources, rather than with a package. In some cases, one may also find them under <filename>/opt/</filename>."
msgstr ""

msgid "For data managing services (such as databases), it is strongly recommended to export the data to a standard format that will be easily imported by the new software. Such a format is usually in text mode and documented; it may be, for example, an SQL dump for a database, or an LDIF file for an LDAP server."
msgstr ""

msgid "Database backups"
msgstr ""

msgid "Each server software is different, and it is impossible to describe all existing cases in detail. Compare the documentation for the existing and the new software to identify the exportable (thus, re-importable) portions and those which will require manual handling. Reading this book will clarify the configuration of the main Linux server programs."

msgid "The first file to check is <filename>/etc/debian_version</filename>, which usually contains the version number for the installed Debian system (it is part of the <emphasis>base-files</emphasis> package). If it indicates <literal><replaceable>codename</replaceable>/sid</literal>, it means that the system was updated with packages coming from one of the development distributions (either testing or unstable)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The <command>apt-show-versions</command> program (from the Debian package of the same name) checks the list of installed packages and identifies the available versions. <command>aptitude</command> can also be used for these tasks, albeit in a less systematic manner."
msgstr ""

msgid "A glance at the <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename> file (and <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</filename> directory) will show where the installed Debian packages likely came from. If many unknown sources appear, the administrator may choose to completely reinstall the computer's system to ensure optimal compatibility with the software provided by Debian."
msgstr ""

msgid "The <filename>sources.list</filename> file is often a good indicator: the majority of administrators keep, at least in comments, the list of APT sources that were previously used. But you should not forget that sources used in the past might have been deleted, and that some random packages grabbed on the Internet might have been manually installed (with the <command>dpkg</command> command). In this case, the machine is misleading in its appearance of “standard” Debian. This is why you should pay attention to any indication that will give away the presence of external packages (appearance of <filename>deb</filename> files in unusual directories, package version numbers with a special suffix indicating that it originated from outside the Debian project, such as <literal>ubuntu</literal> or <literal>lmde</literal>, etc.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Likewise, it is interesting to analyze the contents of the <filename>/usr/local/</filename> directory, whose purpose is to contain programs compiled and installed manually. Listing software installed in this manner is instructive, since this raises questions on the reasons for not using the corresponding Debian package, if such a package exists."

msgid "The <emphasis role=\"pkg\">cruft</emphasis> package proposes to list the available files that are not owned by any package.
